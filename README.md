This application is simple in design with important key features most applications have. I documented most of the application which will give you a better understanding of how everything works.

    You Should be good to go. I created this project to be super simple and easy to understand. 
    This project is more than just a bookstore template. This project is a great learning tool 
    and will help teach you the flutter framework. It utilizes param and non param routes, 
    PageViews and various other features I described above. If you have any questions about 
    the application itself, please ask. This is my first flutter application and would 
    appreciate if you send me some stars if you like it. Thanks again.
