  Name: Flutter Application - Well Read
 
  Description: Well Read is a general template for a bookstore and is a great
  way to learn how the flutter framework is utilized in order to build
  both android and ios mobile applications. I documented most of the
  application which should give you a better understanding of how everything
  works.
 
  Features:
    1. Main()
      a. Utilizes Non-parameter routes
      b. Utilizes Parameter routes
      c. Utilizes Themes
 
    2. LayoutPage()
      a. Builds appBar with icons
      b. Search window
      c. Builds Drawer Navigation Menu with multiple routes
      d. Utilizes a PageView which calls and animates to other pages
      e. Utilizes Snackbars
 
    3. HomePage()
      a. Utilizes a modal with an array of all books
      b. Creates CustomScrollView with a SliverGrid
      c. Displays new Hero Tiles with various books.
 
    4. Each Book Category (Action, History, Horror, Mystery, SciFi)
      a. Utilizes the same tools as HomePage() but displays different books
 
    5. BookDisplayPage()
      a. 2 Part Widget with a top and bottom page
      b. Top Page utilizes a flex view in order to seperate two different containers
      c. Bottom Page utilizes a scroll view enabling you to scroll through the description
      d. Two buttons with Snackbar display
 
    6. Login() and SignUp() Page
      a. Utilizes TextFields for user input
      b. Button to call for validation
 
    7. SettingsPage()
      a. Displays basic user settings and allows for you to input your own settings.
 
    8. Modal Folder
      a. Maintains all dummy data
 
    9. Images Folder
      a. Maintains all image files
 
    10. pubspec.yaml
      a. Allows you to import other assets. All image files you add must be included here
         or you'll get an error. Unless you pull from an API.
 
 
   Basic Installation Process:
         1. Install VS-Code or Android Studio
           a. I prefer Android Studio as it allows access to extra features
              such as Flutter Outline and Inspector.
         2. Install Flutter https://flutter.io/get-started/install/
 
        3. Run 'flutter doctor' to ensure everything is installed correctly and you have a
           working emulator connected.
 
        4. Once everything is working properly open the project and run one of the following commands:
           b. 'flutter clean' --> This cleans the /build folder if flutter
               starts displaying old versions of your application. Doesnt hurt to run this frequently before 'flutter run'
           c. 'flutter run' --> This runs the flutter project.
 
 
       You Should be good to go. I created this project to be super simple and easy to understand. This project is
       more than just a bookstore template. This project is a great learning tool and will help teach you the
       flutter framework. It utilizes param and non param routes, PageViews and various other features I described
       above. If you have any questions about the application itself, please ask. This is my first application on
       CodeCanyon and would appreciate if you send me some stars for my hard work. If I get good feedback,
       I'll build some more. Thanks again.
